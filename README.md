<b>Introduction</b>
<br><br>Mike Bobis is an Electronics Communications Engineer who found his calling in the Software Industry after spending some years in the field of Electronics. Thanks to his 5th Grade Computer Subject, he found a big interest in Programming early on. He was rekindled by his so-called "love for coding" the moment he began to test ICs (intergrated circuits) from a well-known, US Semiconductor company. It was then he realized that there's much to it than just programming scripts, running an automated test, and gathering data of those IC lots for testing. That paved the way for him in transitioning and finding opportunities in the vast world of the Software Industry.

<b>Hobbies</b>
<br><br>Mike loves music - from the classics to the 80s, 90s, New Wave to Heavy Metal, Standards. He basically listens to everything that's pleasant to his ear. He used to play basketball (just like any Filipino kid would do) but eventually realized that he's better of an expectator than a player. He would also watch movies of any genre, whichever that catches his fancy, but his favorites would always be those that have or are based on historical accounts.

<b>Why I wanted to be a Web Developer?</b>
<br><br>I felt that it was my calling. If there's such a thing called "call to Priesthood", " Sacred" or "Spiritual calling", I don't want to sound blasphemous of some sort, but I felt that it was that "thing" for me. Unfortunately, I had to let go of that idea because we were financially challenged during those times and that owning a computer was then too expensive. Now that I'm given a chance, why shouldn't I grab and take it?
